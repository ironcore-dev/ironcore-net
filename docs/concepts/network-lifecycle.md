# Network lifecycle

## ID management

When creating a `Network`, a vacant network ID has to be allocated.
This allocation is done via cluster-scoped `NetworkID` objects.
A `NetworkID`s name is the ID it represents. As such, detecting whether
a `NetworkID` is taken can be easily done by `Get`ting the `NetworkID`
with the ID to check and inspecting the result: If the `NetworkID` is
present, it means it's taken. Otherwise, at least during the time of
inspection, the `NetworkID` is vacant and ready to be claimed.

The `NetworkID` and `Network` are tied together in the
[`Network`'s store `BeforeCreate` hook](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/ironcore-net/blob/main/internal/registry/network/storage.go) using
the [`networkidallocator`](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/ironcore-net/blob/main/internal/registry/network/networkidallocator/networkidallocator.go).

The `Allocator` tries to create `NetworkID`s with the `claimRef` pointing
to the `Network` about to be created. It continues to do so until it either
finds a vacant `NetworkID` (creation succeeds) or it times out after too
many attempts fail (`AlreadyExists` errors).

The valid `NetworkID` range can be configured using the `apiserver`s
`min-vni` / `max-vni` flags.

When deleting a `Network`, the corresponding `NetworkID` is cleaned up
alongside the claiming `Network`.

## Network Peering

When creating network peering both `ironcore` `Network`s has to specify matching, 
`spec.peerings` referencing each other respectively. A `ironcore` `Network` can be peered with 
multiple `network`s in any namespcae.

The `apinetlet` `NetworkController` checks if there are any `peeringClaimRefs` 
present in `ironcore` `Network`. If yes then get `ironcore-net` `Network` 
using `UID` of `peeringClaimRef` and add `spec.ID` of that `ironcore-net` `Network` 
along with corresponding peering name and peering prefixes into `spec.peerings` 
of current `ironcore-net` `Network`.

Once `ironcore-net` `Network` is updated with `spec.peerings`, `metalnetlet` `NetworkController` 
updates `metalnet` `Network`'s `spec.peeredIDs` and `spec.peeredPrefixes` 
from corresponding `ironcore-net` `Network` `spec.peerings`

The `metalnetlet` `NetworkController` also translates `status.peerings` 
in `metalnet` `Network` to `ironcore-net` `Network`'s `status.peerings`.

Then the `apinetlet` `NetworkController` also translates `status.peerings` 
in `ironcore-net` `Network` to `ironcore` `Network`'s `status.peerings`.
