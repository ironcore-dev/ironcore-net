If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. This is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects.

If limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. This field is not supported if watch is true.\n\nThe server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests.

The bookmark will report the ResourceVersion (RV) corresponding to the set of objects, and be marked with `\"k8s.io/initial-events-end\": \"true\"` annotation. Afterwards, the watch stream will proceed as usual, sending watch events corresponding to changes (subsequent to the RV) to objects watched.\n\nWhen `sendInitialEvents` option is set, we require `resourceVersionMatch` option to also be set. The semantic of the watch request is as following: - `resourceVersionMatch` = NotOlderThan\n  is interpreted as \"data at least as new as the provided `resourceVersion`\"\n  and the bookmark event is send when the state is synced\n  to a `resourceVersion` at least as fresh as the one provided by the ListOptions.\n  If `resourceVersion` is unset, this is interpreted as \"consistent read\" and the\n  bookmark event is send when the state is synced at least to the moment\n  when request started being processed.\n- `resourceVersionMatch` set to any other value or unset\n  Invalid error is returned.\n\nDefaults to true if `resourceVersion=\"\"` or `resourceVersion=\"0\"` (for backward compatibility reasons) and to false otherwise.",
